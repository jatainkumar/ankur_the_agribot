Project Title


Overview

A brief, one-to-two sentence description of the project's objective and what the notebook accomplishes.

Prerequisites

Software: A Google Account for Google Colab, Python 3.x.
Dependencies: All required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Installation (Google Colab Environment)

This project is designed to be run in Google Colab, which provides a free, cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment.1 Follow these steps to get set up:
1. Open the Notebook in Colab:
You have two primary options to open this notebook:
Option A: Open Directly from GitHub. If the notebook is in a public GitHub repository, you can open it directly by changing the URL. Replace github.com with colab.research.google.com/github in the notebook's URL and press Enter. The notebook will load directly in the Colab interface.3
Option B: Upload the Notebook. Go to colab.research.google.com, select the "Upload" tab in the pop-up window, and choose the .ipynb file from your local machine.2
2. Install Dependencies:
Once the notebook is open, the first step is to install the required libraries. Run the following command in a code cell to install all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Note that you will need to do this every time you start a new Colab session.4
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Access Project Data and Files:
Colab runtimes are ephemeral, meaning any files you upload directly will be deleted when the session ends.5 To work with persistent data, you should use one of the following methods:
Option A (Recommended): Mount Google Drive. This connects your Google Drive to the Colab environment, allowing you to read and write files directly. Run the following code in a cell and follow the authentication prompts.6
Python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

Your files will then be accessible at the path /content/drive/MyDrive/.
Option B: Clone the Repository. If the project data is included in the GitHub repository, you can clone the entire repository into your Colab session. This will download all files, including scripts and data folders.8
!git clone```

What to Change Before Running (Colab Specifics)

This section outlines the user-specific configurations required to run the notebook successfully.
API Keys and Secrets:
This notebook may require API keys or other secrets to connect to external services. Do not paste secrets directly into the code. The recommended and most secure method is to use Colab's built-in Secrets manager.10
Action:
Click the key icon (ðŸ”‘) in the left sidebar to open the Secrets panel.
Click "Add a new secret".
Enter the secret's name (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY) and paste its value.
Enable the toggle switch to grant this notebook access to the secret.12
In your code, access the secret securely using the userdata module:
Python
from google.colab import userdata
api_key = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')


File Paths:
The notebook reads from input files and writes to output directories. These paths must be updated to point to the correct location in your mounted Google Drive.
Action: Update path variables to reflect your Google Drive structure. For example:
INPUT_DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/data/input_data.csv' 6
OUTPUT_DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab_Notebooks/output/'
Model Parameters:
If the notebook trains a model, key parameters are defined at the beginning of the analysis section.
Action: Review and adjust parameters like learning_rate, n_estimators, or random_state as needed for your specific use case.

Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
This step is handled by Google Colab. Simply ensure you have opened the notebook as described in the installation section.
2. Run the Notebook:
Open the .ipynb file in Colab.
Execute the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

Index Files and Order of Execution

Purpose of an Index File: For complex projects with multiple notebooks, an "index" or "master" notebook (often named Index.ipynb, 00_Start_Here.ipynb, or similar) serves as a central hub or table of contents.13 It provides a high-level overview of the project and outlines the correct sequence for running the other notebooks.
How to Use: If an index file exists, always start there. It will guide you through the project's workflow, ensuring that data processing, modeling, and analysis are performed in the correct order, which is critical for reproducibility.14
Creating an Index File: If this project contains multiple notebooks and lacks an index file, consider creating one. A simple index notebook with Markdown cells that link to the other notebooks in the required order can greatly improve the project's clarity and usability for future users.

Repository Structure

/data: Contains raw and processed data files.
/notebooks: Contains the main Jupyter Notebook for the analysis.
